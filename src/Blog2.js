					<p> Date- April 21, 2010</p>

							<p>The waxing crescent Moon with Earthshine sets in the twilight along with Venus and Mars on January 20, 2015 Venus (at left) shone at magnitude -4.0 and Mars (above and to the right of Venus) at magnitude 1.3.
								A plane Leaves a contrail below the Moon, which was just two days past new and shining at magnitude -6.7.
								Several other faint stars that are visible are part of the constellation of Pisces.
								I was trying out a new 75mm - 300mm f/4.5 - 5.6 cheap Canon Zoom lens for the first time here. I'm pretty sure this is the cheapest Canon 75mm - 300mm zoom lens that Canon makes. This lens was brand new and it cost me $75 at Radio Shack's going out of busness sale.
								The lens does show some color around bright stars, but that is to be expected with an inexpensive lens. You can remove a lot of the color and improve the performance of inexpensive lenses by stopping them down from wide open at f/4.5 about one or two stops. For this image I stopped the lens down to f/5.6 and I'm perfectly happy with the result. Indeed, for $75, I'm ecstatic!

                            <p> The Big Dipper is an asterism that makes up part of the constellation of Ursa Major (The Big Bear). It is seen here at the lower left of the image. The Little Dipper, part of the constellation of Ursa Minor (The Little Bear), is seen at the upper right. Polaris, the North Star, is at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper. Click your mouse cursor in the image to see identifications. Click again to go back to the original imag
								The two stars at the end of the bowl of the Big Dipper, Merak and Dubhe, are called the "Pointer Stars" because a line drawn between them points to Polaris.
