									As I was winding up the fieldwork for Land of Giants, 
									I shifted focus to another of Tsavo’s majestic inhabitants: Black Rhino. 
									Tsavo West is a one of the most ruggedly wild and beautiful landscapes I 
									have encountered in Africa, and a fitting bastion for these ancient mammals. To photograph the rhinos, I partnered with ZSL and KWS.

									F_MU1 was an incredible elephant. For more than 60 years, she lived a peaceful life in a quiet corner of Tsavo in Kenya.
									When I first saw her I was awestruck, for she had the most amazing tusks I had ever seen. If I hadn’t looked upon her with my own eyes, I might not have believed that such an elephant could exist in our world. If there were a Queen of Elephants, it would surely have been her.
