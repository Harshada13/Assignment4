                        <p>This doesn’t only apply to an ocean, it could be a river or a stream, but when you have moving water in your foreground this creates a great opportunity to get your camera low to the flow. This is an excellent way of creating those immersive images where it appears as if the water is flowing directly into the viewers perspective.

                        <p>Whenever you have interesting textures in your foreground, that’s a great opportunity to get low to the ground. You don’t necessarily need to lay on the ground, but dropping your camera a bit closer to the areas of interest is a great way of showing off texture. Being able to accurately portray a specific type of texture, for instance sand in a photo, is a very powerful thing as you wont be able to obviously feel the sand in the photo, but if you can “optically feel” the sand it’s a beautiful thing!
