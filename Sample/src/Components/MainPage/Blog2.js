                        <p>The waxing crescent Moon with Earthshine sets in the twilight along with Venus and Mars on January 20, 2015 Venus (at left) shone at magnitude -4.0 and Mars (above and to the right of Venus) at magnitude 1.3.
                            A plane Leaves a contrail below the Moon, which was just two days past new and shining at magnitude -6.7.
                            Several other faint stars that are visible are part of the constellation of Pisces.
                            I was trying out a new 75mm - 300mm f/4.5 - 5.6 cheap Canon Zoom lens for the first time here. I'm pretty sure this is the cheapest Canon 75mm - 300mm zoom lens that Canon makes. This lens was brand new and it cost me $75 at Radio Shack's going out of busness sale.
                            The lens does show some color around bright stars, but that is to be expected with an inexpensive lens. You can remove a lot of the color and improve the performance of inexpensive lenses by stopping them down from wide open at f/4.5 about one or two stops. For this image I stopped the lens down to f/5.6 and I'm perfectly happy with the result. Indeed, for $75, I'm ecstatic!
